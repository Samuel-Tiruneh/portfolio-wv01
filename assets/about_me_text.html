            <p>
         Hey there! I'm Samuel Tiruneh, born and raised in Gondar, Ethiopia.
         I was born on April 10, 2001, from Azanu Malede and Tiruneh Cheklu.
        My educational journey began at Beza Primary School, and I later
        moved on to Fasiledes High School.
        Since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by technology, specifically
        software and how the internet works. This passion has led me to study 
        software engineering at Bahir Dar University. I'm particularly 
        interested in website development, and my long-term goal is to become
       a successful full-stack developer, creating cutting-edge solutions for clients.
